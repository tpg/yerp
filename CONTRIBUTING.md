# Contributing to Yerp

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. All contributions will be considered, but we can't guarantee that everything will be implemented.

## Pull Requests

- **We only accept code contributions via pull request.** If you want to make a change, make a pull request. If you want to discuss a change, make an issue.
- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)**. To format code automatically use `vendor/bin/pint`.
- **Test!** Please write tests. We don't aim for 100%, but anything that has the potential for failure must be tested.
- **Document.**  The `README.md` and any other relevant documentation should be kept up-to-date to reflect any changes.
- **Consider SemVer.** We follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
- **Create branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per change.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

For any major features or request, please open an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/tpg/yerp/issues) to discuss your ideas.
